# emacs-config


## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository in `~/.config/emacs`.

2. Move, rename or delete any of `.emacs`, `.emacs.el`, and `emacs.d/init.el` present in `$HOME` so that emacs finds and loads `~/.config/emacs/init.el` as its config file. `init.el` in turn will invoke `babel` to generate `emacs.el` from `emacs.org`.

3. Edit `emacs.org` as desired. Do not edit `emacs.el` directly; this file is generated by `babel` and your edits likely will be overwritten.
